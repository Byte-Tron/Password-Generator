## 🚀 Introduction

In an age of constant data breaches, a strong and unique password for every account is non-negotiable. This Advanced Password Generator provides a simple, secure, and powerful tool to create such passwords. It operates entirely on the client-side (your browser), meaning **no passwords are ever sent over the internet or stored on a server**. Your security and privacy are paramount.

This project was built to demonstrate modern JavaScript features and best practices for creating a secure, interactive web application.

## 🌟 Features

This isn't just another password generator. It comes packed with advanced features for full control and security:

*   **🎛️ Highly Customizable:**
    *   Adjustable password length (from 8 to 128 characters).
    *   Include/exclude character types:
        *   Uppercase Letters (`A-Z`)
        *   Lowercase Letters (`a-z`)
        *   Numbers (`0-9`)
        *   Symbols (`!@#$%^&*()`)
*   **💪 Password Strength Indicator:** A visual bar and text that updates in real-time to show the estimated strength of the generated password (e.g., Weak, Medium, Strong, Very Strong).
*   **🔐 Secure & Private:** Uses the cryptographically secure `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` API for generating random values, instead of the insecure `Math.random()`.
*   **📋 One-Click Copy:** Easily copy the generated password to your clipboard.
*   **❌ Exclude Ambiguous Characters:** Option to exclude confusing characters like `I`, `l`, `1`, `O`, `0`.
*   **📱 Fully Responsive Design:** A clean, modern UI that works beautifully on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **💡 Lightweight & Fast:** No frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for optimal performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content.
*   **CSS3:** For modern styling, animations, and a responsive layout (using Flexbox/Grid).
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the logic, interactivity, and secure password generation. No external libraries or frameworks needed.

<!-- If you used any frameworks like React, Vue, or build tools like Vite/Webpack, add them here. -->

## 👨‍💻 Usage

Using the generator is straightforward:

1.  **Set Password Length:** Use the slider to choose your desired password length.
2.  **Select Character Sets:** Check the boxes for the types of characters you want to include.
3.  **Click "Generate Password":** A new, secure password will be created based on your settings.
4.  **Copy:** Click the copy icon to instantly copy the password to your clipboard.

## 🧠 How It Works

The core of the generator's security lies in its method of creating randomness.

1.  **Character Pool:** Based on the user's selected options (uppercase, lowercase, etc.), a "pool" of all possible characters is created.
2.  **Secure Randomization:** Instead of `Math.random()`, which is not suitable for cryptographic purposes, we use the **`window.crypto.getRandomValues()`** Web API. This API provides a cryptographically secure source of random numbers directly from your operating system.
3.  **Password Assembly:** The application generates a secure random number for each character in the password, using it to pick a character from the pool. This ensures that the selection is unbiased and unpredictable.
4.  **Shuffling:** The final password string is shuffled one last time to protect against any potential bias in character placement.
